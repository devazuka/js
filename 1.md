## Hello There 👋

### Values

You have 3 types of values, and with them you can model the **WORLD** !\
In the end it's all `1`'s and `0`'s for the computer, but us humans we need easier
ways of representing stuff.

> We can all agree that `11010001100101110110011011001101111` is not a very
> friendly way to say `'hello'` !

#### Numbers

- Whole numbers: `1`, `23`, `232139283`
- Negative numbers are prefixed with `-`: `-1`, `-1231`
- Decimal numbers: `3.14`, `-2.53343` etc...

You use them to represent quantities, like we do everyday in life.

#### Booleans

- Something is `true`
- or `false`

They represent a truth, an answer to a closed-ended question _(anything that can
be answerd yes or no)_:

- Is your computer turned ? `true`
- Are you born before 1723 ? `false`
- Is paris the capital of France ? `true`

#### Strings

- `'Hello'`
- `'This is some text'`

They represent text, they are very flexibles and the most complexe of the 3
because you need a delimiter to define its begining and end, it can be any
matching quotes `` ` ``, `"` or `'`.

### Using `console.log`

To display output from a script into a console, you must use the function
`console.log`:

```js
console.log() // <- will show an empty line
```

Add the value you want between the parentheses to see it appear when you execute
your script.

> This is very important to use often to validate that your code is valid. The
> more you test, the easier it will be for you to understand what's going on in
> your code !
>
> In doubt, `console.log` everything, don't be shy, they are free.

### Instructions

Write a program that displays the exact text `Hello There !`, any `Number` and a
`Boolean` when you run it.

### Tests

> Testing your code can be more complicated than your solution. Don't worry, as
> you don't need to understand them.\
> Once you start understanding code a bit, they may clarify what the subject is about.

#### Log a number in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const typeOfLoggedValues = args.flat().map(v => typeof v)
if (!typeOfLoggedValues.includes('number')) {
  throw Error('you must log a number')
}
```

#### Log a boolean in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const typeOfLoggedValues = args.flat().map(v => typeof v)
if (!typeOfLoggedValues.includes('boolean')) {
  throw Error('you must log a boolean')
}
```

#### Log a string in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const typeOfLoggedValues = args.flat().map(v => typeof v)
if (!typeOfLoggedValues.includes('string')) {
  throw Error('you must log a string')
}
```

#### Log the string `Hello There !` in the console

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('Hello There !')) {
  throw Error('you must log the text Hello There !')
}
```

## Anything to Declare ?

### Variables

Now that we've got values, we need a way to identify them.

That's why we use variables, they add meaning to a value by pointing to it.

It's like a label, a way to name things.

If we have just the value `20`, it doesn't carry much meaning, `20` what ?

Let's imagine we are talking about what's in your backpack, so you have 20 pairs
of socks.

#### Example

So we use an identifier to define what it is, using this syntax:

```js
let pairOfSocks = 20
```

> Woa what's all this ?!

Well keep on reading, we will explain each parts.

#### Keyword: `let`

first we got a keyword `let`.

> A `keyword` is a special word that JS knows about, it is used to tell the
> computer to perform a specific action.

`let` that indicate your script that you are defining a new variable.

#### Identifier

After that, you need a **valid** identifier.

In this case it's `pairOfSocks`, you chose what ever you want here that will be
meaningful, it's often hard to name things correctly.

A few rules to apply to make sure your identifier are valid:

- No space allowed _(`pair of socks` would be 3 distinct identifiers)_
- Not **starting** with a number _(that's reserved for number values)_
- Not being a reserved keyword _(for example using `let`)_
- No special characters

As such we use what we call `camelCase`.

> Note that in JS it is a convention to not uppercase the first letter as this
> is reserved for special declarations we won't go into details now.

```js
let pair of socks = 20 // invalid because of spaces
let 'pair of socks' = 20 // invalid because identifiers are not strings
let pair-of-socks = 20 // invalid because of special character -
let pair.of.socks = 20 // invalid because of special character /
let 20PairOfSocks = 20 // invalid because begining by a number
let PairOfSocks = 20 // valid but incorrect because of the uppercase
let pairOfSocks = 20 // Just right
let let = true // invalid because `let` is a JS keyword
```

#### Operator: `=`

We can see here we also use the special character `=`, that's our first
**operator**, like in math, they are used to define specific operations.

In this case, single `=` define the `assignation` operation.

It means we assign a value to our variable.

This is what links the `identifier` we choose with our `value`.

#### Value

Lastly, a value, those we already talk about.

Either a `string`, a `number` or a `boolean`.

Full example with descriptive comments:

```js
// ↙ keyword        ↙ assignation operator
let comicBookTitle = 'Tintin in Tibet'
//       ↖ identifier       ↖ the value (here a string)
```

Using multiple variables to define something more complex:

```js
// Example of variables that could represent a transaction:
let currency = 'EURO'
let amount = 77.5
let cashPayment = false

// You can use them with console.log, like you would a normal value:
console.log('You have to pay:')
console.log(amount)
console.log('in')
console.log(currency)
console.log('using cash:')
console.log(cashPayment)
```

### Instructions

All right, before we can embark into this adventure, you are going to tell us
more about yourself using **variables** !

- Declare a variable _indentified_ `age` of a `Number` value of your age

- Declare a variable _indentified_ `name` of a `String` value of your name

- Declare a variable _indentified_ `secureLuggage` of a `Boolean` saying if your
  luggage contain dangerous things or not. _(for obvious security reasons)_

> PS: And please, use reasonable values, or the tests might reject you !

### Tests

#### Create a `age` variable of your age as a number

```js
equal(typeof age, 'number')
```

#### Create a `name` variable of your name as a string

```js
equal(typeof name, 'string')
```

#### Create a `secureLuggage` variable of a boolean

```js
equal(typeof secureLuggage, 'boolean')
```

#### Values must be reasonable

```js
if (age <= 3) {
  throw Error(`You must be over 3 years old to pass this exericse`)
}

if (age > 99) {
  throw Error(`You are too old for this`)
}

if (name.length <= 1) {
  throw Error('Your name must be more than 1 letter long')
}

if (name.length > 99) {
  throw Error('Your name must be more than 1 letter long')
}

if (secureLuggage === false) {
  throw Error(
    `Do you really believe we are going to let you pass with insecure luggage ?!`,
  )
}
```

## An Undefined Future

### Undefined

In your previous exercise, you might have encouter `undefined` already.

It's the value of a variable not having a value !

We say the value was not defined.

### Instructions

Find a way to declare a variable `myFuture` without defining it's value

Because after all, we don't know what's your future hold !

### Tests

#### `myFuture` must be declared but it's value `undefined`

```js
equal(myFuture, undefined)
```

## The Great Escape

### Escaping

Let's talk a bit more about strings now, as we go you will see that we can do a
lot with them.

But one of the tricky things to deal with are those **quote delimiters**.

Since they are used for delimiting your text, we need a trick to include them in
our text

For example, this is invalid:

```js
console.log('Houdini once said:')
console.log('Magic is the sole science not accepted by scientists,')
//                    Uh oh... ↙ JS thinks your string ends here
console.log(' because they can't understand it.')
//                       ...and new starts here ↖ that never finish !
// too bad ! a quote, ruined by quotes, ironic and very sad.
```

For that, we use the backslash character (`\`):

Everytime you need to add an extra special character into your string, putting a
`\` in front of it will **escape** it and doing so will let JS understand you
ment the litteral following character and not the delimiter, _or whatever else
you are trying to write_

### Instructions

Nothing can stop you now with that knew knowledge. Like Houdini, master of
escape, you are going escape some strings:

- Create a `escapeFromDelimiters` that includes all 3 quotes _(`` ` ``, `"` and
  `'`)_.

- Create a `escapeTheEscape` that includes a backslash _(`\`)_.

### Tests

#### `escapeFromDelimiters` is declared and includes a double-quote

```js
if (typeof escapeFromDelimiters === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the variable... we've been through this already !`,
  )
}

if (!escapeFromDelimiters.includes('"')) {
  throw Error('escapeFromDelimiters must include a double-quote"')
}
```

#### `escapeFromDelimiters` includes a single-quote

```js
if (!escapeFromDelimiters.includes("'")) {
  throw Error("escapeFromDelimiters must include a single-quote'")
}
```

#### `escapeFromDelimiters` includes a backtick

```js
if (!escapeFromDelimiters.includes('`')) {
  throw Error('escapeFromDelimiters must include a backtick `')
}
```

#### `escapeTheEscape` includes a backslash

```js
if (!new TextEncoder().encode(escapeTheEscape).includes(92)) {
  throw Error('escapeTheEscape must includes a backslash')
}
```

## A String of Number

In this one we will try to confirm your now able to distinguish strings and
numbers.

### Instructions

Declare two variables:

- use the identifier `seven` with value being a string of the number `7`
- use the identifier `seventySeven` with value being a string of the number `77`

> _wait, can you repeat that ?_

### Tests

#### As a number, `seven` value is `7`

```js
equal(Number(seven), 7)
```

#### As a number, `seventySeven` value is `77`

```js
equal(Number(seventySeven), 77)
```

#### Somehow, the type of `seven` and `seventySeven` value must be strings

```js
equal(typeof seven, 'string')
equal(typeof seventySeven, 'string')
```

## Redeclaration of Love

### Assign, re-assign

Remember the `let` keyword, we use declare a new variable.

> Note that we can't have multiple variables with the same identifier otherwhise
> JS wouldn't know which one is which.

Redeclaring a variable will make your code crash !

But we can still use the `=` _(assignation operator)_ to change it's value !

### Instructions

The variable `love` has been declared and will be used during the tests.

You must try to re-assign the `love` variable to the string value
`I still love you !!` but without re-declaring it !

> Exclamations points are important `!!` as love is a serious declaration.

### Tests

#### The value of `love` must have changed

```js
let love = 'You used to love me !!'

// Your code

equal(love, 'I still love you !!')
```

> Note that sometimes you may find variable delcared with `const` this means
> that the assignation is constant and can never be re-assigned !
>
> It is used to protect your code against errors, but you can always use `let`
> in it's place.
>
> Also you may find online old code using `var` we are trying to get rid of

## Smooth Operator

### Math Operators

We will now learn other operators than assignation, for now let's focus on the
one you probably already know

- `+` Addition
- `-` Substraction
- `/` Division
- `*` Multiplication

Those operators are used the same way we would write it in normal math:

```js
console.log(5 + 7) // -> 12
console.log(5 * 5) // -> 25
console.log(7 - 5) // -> 2
console.log(9 / 3) // -> 3
```

Operators are evaluated using classic priority:

```js
console.log(1 + 5 * 10) // -> 51
```

you can use parens `()` to enforce priority:

```js
console.log((1 + 5) * 10) // -> 60
```

And the are resulting in a value, you can as such assign them to variables:

```js
let halfMyAge = 33 / 2
let twiceMyAge = 33 * 2
```

### Instructions

Your code must use the given variable `smooth` as our initial value

You will declare a few variables:

- `lessSmooth` that is just `1` less than `smooth`

- `semiSmooth` that is the half the amount of `smooth` _(it's still pretty
  smooth)_

- `plus11` that is `smooth` plus `11`

- `ultraSmooth` that is the square of smooth _(now that's smooth !)_

### Explications

### Tests

#### values of the variable are a result of the operations on the variable smooth (`10`)

```js
let smooth = 10

// Your code

equal(lessSmooth, 9)
equal(semiSmooth, 5)
equal(plus11, 21)
```

#### values of the variable are a result of the operations on the variable smooth (`27`)

```js
let smooth = 27

// Your code
equal(lessSmooth, 26)
equal(semiSmooth, 13.5)
equal(plus11, 38)
```

#### ultraSmooth should be the square of the value of smooth (`10`)

```js
let smooth = 10

// Your code

equal(ultraSmooth, 100)
```

#### ultraSmooth should be the square of the value of smooth (`27`)

```js
let smooth = 27

// Your code

equal(ultraSmooth, 729)
```

## Placeholders

Now that we know operation on numbers, let's check out what we can do with
strings :)

### Strings `` `${placeholders}` ``

The first one is too use `placeholders` to use values from variables from inside
our strings.

For that we introduce a new syntax, the placeholder `${}`.

#### Example

```js
console.log(`5 + 10 = ${5 + 10} = 15`) // -> 5 + 10 = 15 = 15
```

Note that it only works using the `` ` `` backtick, not the `"` or `'` quotes.

```js
// here the placeholder is not evaluated and we see it as text:
console.log('5 + 10 = ${5 + 10} = 15') // -> 5 + 10 = ${5 + 10} = 15
```

This may not look like much, but you can do a lot with it, better get used to it
fast.

### Instructions

We provide a variable `name` and `age`.

Create a `presentation` variable of the string:

> Hello, my name is `name` and I'm `age` years old

But use placeholders to build the string from the values of the provided
variables `age` and `name`.

### Tests

#### `presentation` value includes `age` and `name`.

```js
let name = 'Patrick'
let age = 48

// Your code
equal(presentation, `Hello, my name is Patrick and I'm 48 years old`)
```

#### `presentation` value still includes `age` and `name`.

```js
let name = 'Jeremy'
let age = 27

// Your code
equal(presentation, `Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm 27 years old`)
```

## Duplicate

Sometimes in life, and in learning, it's important to repeat yourself.

In this one, you will use string placeholders to duplicate a string, so we can
make sure we get our point across.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `duplicate` that repeat the provided variable `sentence`,
separated by a `, ` and add an ` !` at the end.

> so if sentence would be `Hello there`, we expect `Hello there, Hello there !`.

### Tests

#### `duplicate` value should repeat `'I told you so'`

```js
let sentence = 'I told you so'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'I told you so, I told you so !')
```

#### `duplicate` value should repeat `'Not again'`

```js
let sentence = 'Not again'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'Not again, Not again !')
```

#### `duplicate` value should repeat `'I knew it'`

```js
let sentence = 'I knew it'
// Your code
equal(duplicate, 'I knew it, I knew it !')
```

## 🌟 Unchanging

You are now begining **BONUS** exercises, those are made to make you explore JS
a bit more by yourself and show you more obscure / wierd aspect of the language.

**Only spend time on those if you are a head !**

If you feel already a bit overwhelmed by all you had to learn so far, don't feel
bad to skip them.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `unchanging` of the value of your choice, but you must make
sure it can not be re-assigned.

### Tests

#### Test to re-assign the value

```js
let originalValue = unchanging
try {
  unchanging = 'new value'
} catch {}

if (unchanging !== originalValue) {
  throw Error('unchanging value changed !')
}
```

#### Test with to re-assign with another value

```js
let originalValue = unchanging
try {
  unchanging = 'another new value'
} catch {}

if (unchanging !== originalValue) {
  throw Error('unchanging value changed !')
}
```

## 🌟 Inequality

### Instructions

Create a `inequality` value that is not equal to itself

### Notions

  throw Error('must be bigger !')
}

if (smalls > -1.7976931348623157e308) {
  throw Error('must be smaller !')
}
