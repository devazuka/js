# Conditions

## what if ?

Methods and built-in functions are good, but must of the time we have to write
our own logic and the first block for that are **conditions**.

### The `if` keyword

The `if` keyword allow you to run lines of code _only if_ the condition is
right, example:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

### Condition `()`

following our `if` is a `condition` delimited by `()` parentheses,

### Comparaison operators `>`

Inside our condition is a comparaison (using the _greater than_ operator `>`).\
This line (`if (age > 48)`) reads:

> If age is greater than 48, then do the following code

There are 6 different comparaison opperators:

- `===` _(equal to)_
- `!==` _(not equal to)_
- `>` _(greater than)_
- `<` _(lesser than)_
- `<=` _(lesser than or equal)_
- `>=` _(greater than or equal)_

Every comparaison operator are _like_ functions, they take 2 arguments, one on
the right and one on the left, and return a boolean value. Either `true`, the
condition is met, or `false` if it's not.

Since they return value, you can assign them to variables, just like functions
return values:

```js
let age = 5
let ageEqual5 = age === 5 // age equal to 5
let ageNotEqual5 = age !== 5 // age not equal to 5
console.log(ageEqual5) // true
console.log(ageNotEqual5) // false
```

But they are commonly used directly inside an `if` condition.

### Scope `{}`

After the condition, a curly brace `{` signal the begining of a scope. The scope
ends at the enclosing `}` a few lines after.

Scopes are a way to group lines of code, this allow us to do multiple lines of
code if a condition is true.

### Indentation `..` _(2 spaces)_

Upon writing code inside a scope, it's an important convention to **indent** it.

Indenting is when spaces are added at the beging of the line, here an example of
bad code:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  // <- without indentation ! bad bad ! unreadable !!
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

good code:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  // <- with indentation, omg so clean, amazing !
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

Indenting add a visual indication that the code is inside a scope, while it's
not strictly necessary for code to work, it will become very important to keep
the code clear.

#### test 1

```js
let age = 12
```

#### test 2

```

#### test 3

## NOT `!`

## AND `&&`

## OR `||`

## AND + OR (`&&` + `||`) + GROUPING

## if + `.methods()`

    startsWith / endWith

## What else ?

    if / else + includes?

## if / else if / else + indexOf

## nested if / else

## nested if / else + lastIndexOf
