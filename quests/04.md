# Conditions

## Griswold the Blacksmith ‚öíÔ∏è

Methods and built-in functions are good, but most of the time we have to write
our own logic and the first block for that are **conditions**.

### The `if` keyword

The `if` keyword allows you to run lines of code _only if_ the condition is
right, example:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

### Condition `()`

following our `if` is a `condition` delimited by `()` parentheses,

### Comparaison operators `>`

Inside our condition is a comparaison (using the _greater than_ operator `>`).\
This code `if (age > 48)` reads:

> If age is greater than 48, then do the following code

There are 6 different comparaison opperators:

- `>` _greater than_
- `<` _lesser than_
- `<=` _lesser than or equal_
- `>=` _greater than or equal_
- `===` _equal to_
- `!==` _not equal to_

Every comparaison operator are _like_ functions, they take 2 arguments, one on
the right and one on the left, and returns a boolean value. Either `true`, if
the condition is met, or `false` if it's not.

Since they return value, you can assign them to variables, just like functions
return values:

```js
let age = 5
let ageEqual5 = age === 5 // age is equal to 5
let ageNotEqual5 = age !== 5 // age is not equal to 5
console.log(ageEqual5) // true
console.log(ageNotEqual5) // false
```

But they are commonly used directly inside an `if` condition.

### Scope `{}`

After the condition, a curly brace `{` signal the begining of a scope. The scope
ends at the enclosing `}` a few lines after.

Scopes are a way to group lines of code, this allow us to do multiple lines of
code if a condition is true.

```js
if (age > 48) {
  // <-beginning of the scope of the if condition
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
} // <- end of the scope of the if condition
```

### Indentation `..` _(2 spaces)_

Upon writing code inside a scope, it's an important convention to **indent** it.

Indenting is when spaces are added at the beginning of the line, here is an
example of bad code:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
if (age > 48) {
// <- without indentation ! bad bad ! unreadable !!
console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

good code:

```js
if (age > 48) {
  // <- with indentation, omg so clean, amazing !
  console.log('You are over 48 years old')
}
```

Indenting add a visual indication that the code is inside a scope, while it's
not strictly necessary for code to work, it will become very important to keep
the code clear.

### Instructions

You are Griswold the Blacksmith, and you must give the list of items the player
can buy with the money he has, here is what you are selling:

- arrows for 3 coins
- boots for 44 coins
- sword for 299.99 coins _(limited offer)_

Declare a `purchasableGoods` array and _conditionally_ push to it all the goods
that the player can buy.

Use `if` conditions and compare the cost of the goods with the provided variable
`playerCoins` that contains the number of coins available to the player.

> You must order elements by price

### Tests

#### if the player can't buy anything, the array should be empty

```js
let playerCoins = 2

// Your code

if (!Array.isArray(purchasableGoods)) {
  throw Error(`purchasableGoods must be declared and an array`)
}

equal(purchasableGoods.length, 0)
```

#### if the player can only buy arrows

```js
let playerCoins = 3

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows'])
```

#### if the player can buy arrows and the boots

```js
let playerCoins = 50

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows', 'boots'])
```

#### if the player can buy everything

```js
let playerCoins = 299.99

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows', 'boots', 'sword'])
```

#### if the player can buy everything, and more

```js
let playerCoins = 999

// Your code

equal(purchasableGoods, ['arrows', 'boots', 'sword'])
```

## The True King üëë

### Instructions

If the provided variable `name` is the string `'Arthur'` you must change the
value of the provided variable `excalibur` to `'pulled'`

### Tests

#### if the name is `'Perceval'` excalibur should stay set in stone

```js
let name = 'Perceval'
let excalibur = 'set in stone'

// Your code

equal(excalibur, 'set in stone')
```

#### if the name is `'Merlin'` excalibur should stay set in stone

```js
let name = 'Merlin'
let excalibur = 'set in stone'

// Your code

equal(excalibur, 'set in stone')
```

#### if the name is `'Arthur'` excalibur should be pulled

```js
let name = 'Arthur'
let excalibur = 'set in stone'

// Your code

equal(excalibur, 'pulled')
```

## Seeker of Truth

### Truthy and Falsy

In JS, all values are either **truthy** or **falsy**, this means if used in a
condition, truthy values will validate the condition while falsy values would
not.

Here is the list of falsy values:

- `undefined` and `null`
- the numbers `0` and `NaN`
- the empty string `''`
- and the boolean `false` of course

All other values are truthy, note that empty arrays and empty objects are
truthy, but the empty string is not.

```js
if ('') {
  console.log('Since empty string are falsy, this will never log')
}

if ('hello') {
  console.log('this will always log as the string is not empty')
}
```

### Operator `!`

The `!` (NOT operator) can be used to convert a truthy value to `false` or a
falsy value to `true`.

example:

```js
let money = 0
let noMoney = !money

console.log(noMoney) // true
```

In this case, 0 is falsy, so the `!` return the value `true`

### Instructions

Seek the truth and claim your verdict !

- Log `'The truth was spoken.'` if the value of the provided variable `truth` is
  truthy
- Log `'Lies !!!!'` if the value of the provided variable `truth` is falsy

### Tests

#### Test with the falsy value `0`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = 0

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `NaN`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = NaN

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `undefined`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = undefined

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `null`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = null

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `''`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = ''

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the falsy value `false`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = false

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'Lies !!!!')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `'Sure'`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = 'Sure'

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `[]`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = []

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `{}`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = {}

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `true`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = true

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

#### Test with the truthy value `-0.1`

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let truth = -0.1

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'The truth was spoken.')
```

## Special Promo üéüÔ∏è

### `&&` (the AND operator)

This operator is used to group conditions:

```js
if (user.role === 'admin' && user.available === 'now') {
  console.log('Admin', user.name, 'is available and will help you now !')
}
```

Here, the code will only show the message if **both** conditions are true.

### Instructions

Your traveling company have a new special promo for members between 18 and 25
years old.

Write the `if` condition that will check if the user can benefit the promotion:

- `user.age` must be at least `18`
- `user.age` must be lesser or equal to `25`
- `user.activeMembership` must be `true`

If all of those conditions are true, `console.log` the message
`You can benefit from our special promotion`

### Tests

#### Test with a user that can have the promotion

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 22 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'You can benefit from our special promotion')
```

#### Test with a user that is too old

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 33 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], undefined)
```

#### Test with a user that is too young

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 12 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], undefined)
```

#### Test with a user that doesn't have an active membership

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: false, age: 21 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], undefined)
```

#### Test with a user that can have the promotion but is just at the limit

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let user = { activeMembership: true, age: 25 }

// Your code

equal(args[0]?.[0], 'You can benefit from our special promotion')
```

## Time to Pay üí∏

### `||` (the OR operator)

The other way to group condtions:

```js
if (user.role === 'admin' || user.role === 'moderator') {
  console.log(user.name, 'has access to moderation pages.')
}
```

Here, the code will only show the message if **any** conditions are true.

### Instructions

You are selling planes tickets, they all cost `9.99$` you must confirm that the
`customer` has the means to buy this ticket. The `customer` may have enough
`cash` or a `voucher`

Check if the provided variable `customer` can afford the ticket:

- whether he has enough cash (`customer.cash` property)
- or, if he has a voucher (`customer.hasVoucher` property is `true`)

If so, you must increment the provided variable `ticketSold` value by `1`.

### Tests

#### Test with a customer that has enough cash

```js
let ticketSold = 8
let customer = { cash: 20, hasVoucher: false }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 9)
```

#### Test with a customer that has a voucher

```js
let ticketSold = 5
let customer = { cash: 0, hasVoucher: true }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 6)
```

#### Test with a customer that has a voucher and cash

```js
let ticketSold = 6
let customer = { cash: 42, hasVoucher: true }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 7)
```

#### Test with a customer that can not afford the ticket

```js
let ticketSold = 3
let customer = { cash: 3, hasVoucher: false }

// Your code

equal(ticketSold, 3)
```

## Security

### AND + OR (`&&` + `||`)

Combining `&&` and `||` builds complex logical conditions.

You can use `()` to group them.

### Instructions

The infamous **virus19** is spreading ! As an airport control agent your role is
to ensure that the traveler is safe for his flight.

You must define the `traveler.isImmune` property to `true` if either:

- both `traveler.alreadyHadTheVirus` and `traveler.recovered` are `true`
- or `traveler.isVaccinated` is `true`

### Tests

#### Test a traveler that is still has the virus

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: true,
  recovered: false,
  isVaccinated: false,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, false)
```

#### Test a traveler that has recovered

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: true,
  recovered: true,
  isVaccinated: false,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, true)
```

#### Test a traveler who never had the virus and isn't vaccinated

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: false,
  recovered: false,
  isVaccinated: false,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, false)
```

#### Test a traveler that is vaccinated

```js
let traveler = {
  alreadyHadTheVirus: false,
  recovered: false,
  isVaccinated: true,
}

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, true)
```

#### Test a traveler that is vaccinated and recovered from the virus

```js
let traveler = { alreadyHadTheVirus: true, recovered: true, isVaccinated: true }

// Your code

equal(traveler.isImmune, true)
```
