# Declaring Functions

## What is my purpose

### Remember Methods?

You have seen how to call functions that were stored in object properties.

Remember this example of function call?:

```js
//       â†™ identifier, like variables
console.log('Hello There !') // <- function call happening here
//          â†– open paren + argument + close paren
```

or these ones?:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // another function call happening here
console.log(roundedValue) // and another one here
```

There, we saw how to call and use _"pre-declared"_ functions.

Here, now, we are going to learn how to declare our owns. This will gives us
even more freedom to build our own logic.

### Declaring a very basic function

We mentioned before that a function had to be either assigned to a variable or
an object property.

We will now declare one in a variable. Let's call it: `myFirstFunction`.

```js
//    â†™ normal variable     â†™ beginning of the scope of the function
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  //                    â†– parens () and arrow =>
} // <-end of the scope of the function
```

It's now possible to call this function using the `()`, like any pre-declared
function:

```js
myFirstFunction() // nothing happens
```

This function if called, does not do anything, since it doesn't contain any
code.

### The scope of a function `{}`

Very much like an `if` statement a function has a scope. The scope in between
the curly braces`{}` is where the action happens. Let's add something to the
scope of our function.

```js
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  console.log('Calling my first function')
  // â†– some instructions to do when the function is called !
}
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log()`.

```js
myFirstFunction() // "Calling my first function"
```

We actually used a function and gave it this single instruction:

- call another function `console.log()`.

### Instructions

You are a robot made by scientist called rick and you want to know your purpose.
We have declared the variable `butterPassed` and the object `dialogue`. Declare
your function named `whatIsMyPurpose`.

This function will:

- First, display in the console the value of the key `myQuestion` in the object
  `dialogue`
- Then, display in the console the valu}e of the key `Rick's answer` in the
  object `dialogue`
- Reassign the Boolean `butterPassed` to `true`
- Display in the console the value of the key `reaction` in the object
  `dialogue`

Hint : Make sure your console is open if you want to see the actual answer :)

### Tests

#### whatIsMyPurpose is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose != 'function') {
  throw Error('whatIsMyPurpose must be a function')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPurpose has no arguments

```js
if (whatIsMyPurpose.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### Is my purpose fullfilled by my function

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let butterPassed = false
let dialogue = {
  question: 'What is my purpose?',
  "rick's answer": 'You pass the butter.',
  reaction: 'What is my purpose?',
}

// Your code

whatIsMyPurpose()
if (butterPassed != true) {
  console.log('butterPassed:', butterPassed)
  throw Error(
    'yourFunction must accomplish your purpose (assign the butterPassed to true)',
  )
}

dialogue.reaction = '...Oh my god...'
whatIsMyPurpose()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('What is my purpose?')) {
  throw Error('you must log the value of the key: question')
}
const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('You pass the butter.')) {
  throw Error(`you must log the value of the key: "rick's answer"`)
}
const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('...Oh my god...')) {
  throw Error('you must log the value of the key: reaction')
}
```

## function with one argument

## function with 2 arguments

## function with return value

## function with arguments return value

## function with arguments return value and conditions

## ðŸŒŸ variable arguments (...rest)

## ðŸŒŸ ternaires + implicit return
