### Remember Methods?

You have seen how to call functions that were stored in object properties.

Remember this example of function call?:

```js
//       â†™ identifier, like variables
console.log('Hello There !') // <- function call happening here
//          â†– open paren + argument + close paren
```

or these ones?:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // another function call happening here
console.log(roundedValue) // and another one here
```

There, we saw how to call and use _"pre-declared"_ functions.

Here, now, we are going to learn how to declare our owns. This will gives us
even more freedom to build our own logic.

### Declaring a very basic function

We mentioned before that a function had to be either assigned to a variable or
an object property.

We will now declare one in a variable. Let's call it: `myFirstFunction`.

Once a variable is declared;
Remember how an array can be recognized with this syntax : `[]`?
or an object with this one : `{}` ?

Well, we will use another syntax for declaring our function.
We will do so using the `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax : `() => {}`

- So we first put parens `()`,
These, are the containers of the `arguments` that go in the function.
For now we will leave them empty with no arguments. (More on those
later on)
- We then add the arrow `=>` which is the distinguishing feature of
the `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax.
- Finally, we add the curly brackets `{}` to delimite the scope
of our newly created function.
Note: They are not always necessary, you will probably find examples
of this function syntax without the `{}`.
However, for now because you are learning. We will put them most
of the time.

```js
//    â†™ normal variable     â†™ beginning of the scope of the function
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  //                    â†– parens () for arguments and the arrow => for syntax
} // <-end of the scope of the function
```

It's now possible to call this function using the `()`, like any pre-declared
function:

```js
myFirstFunction() // nothing happens
```

This function if called, does not do anything, since it doesn't contain any
code.

### The scope of a function `{}`

Very much like an `if` statement a function has a scope. The scope in between
the curly braces`{}` is where the action happens. Let's add something to the
scope of our function.

```js
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  console.log('Calling my first function')
  // â†– some instructions to do when the function is called !
}
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log()`.

```js
myFirstFunction() // "Calling my first function"
```

We actually used a function and gave it this single instruction:

- call another function `console.log()`.

### Instructions

You are a robot made by scientist called rick and you want to know your purpose.
We have declared the object `dialogue`. Declare **and call** a function named `whatIsMyPurpose`.

- This function will display in the console the value of the key `myQuestion`
in the object `dialogue`.

Declare **and call** a function named `theAnswer`.

- This function will display in the console the value of the key `Rick's answer`
in the object `dialogue`.

Hint : Make sure your console is open if you want to see the actual answer :)

### Tests

#### whatIsMyPurpose is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function whatIsMyPurpose... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose != 'function') {
  throw Error('whatIsMyPurpose must be a function')
}
```
#### theAnswer is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof theAnswer === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function theAnswer... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof theAnswer != 'function') {
  throw Error('theAnswer must be a function')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPurpose has no arguments

```js
if (whatIsMyPurpose.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### theAnswer has no arguments

```js
if (theAnswer.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPupose works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let dialogue = {
  question: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass the butter.'
}

// Your code

whatIsMyPurpose()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('What is my purpose?')) {
  throw Error('you must log the value of the key: question')
}
const functionCalls = args.flat().filter((el)=>(el === 'What is my purpose?')).length
if (functionCalls != 2) {
  throw Error(`you must call the function whatIsMyPurpose once"`)
}
```

#### theAnswer works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let dialogue = {
  question: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass the butter.'
}

// Your code

theAnswer()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('You pass the butter.')) {
  throw Error(`you must log the value of the key: "Rick's answer"`)
}
const functionCalls = args.flat().filter((el)=>(el === 'You pass the butter.')).length
if (functionCalls != 2) {
  throw Error(`you must call the function theAnswer once"`)
}
```
}
const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('...Oh my god...')) {
  throw Error('you must log the value of the key: reaction')
}
```

## function with one argument

## function with 2 arguments

## function with return value

## function with arguments return value

## function with arguments return value and conditions

## ðŸŒŸ variable arguments (...rest)
