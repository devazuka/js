# Declaring Functions

## What is my purpose ?

![robot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/489466992286498816/828181029772197888/butter-purpose.png)

You have seen how to call functions that were stored in object properties.

Remember this example of function call ?

```js
//       ↙ identifier, like variables
console.log('Hello There !') // <- function call happening here
//          ↖ open paren + argument + close paren
```

or these ones:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // another function call happening here
console.log(roundedValue) // and another one here
```

There, we saw how to call and use _"built-in"_ functions.

Here, now, we are going to learn how to declare our owns. This will gives us
even more freedom to build our own logic.

### Declaring a function

We mentioned before that a function had to be either assigned to a variable or
an object property.

We will now declare one in a variable. Let's call it: `myFirstFunction`.

Once a variable is declared; Remember how an array can be recognized with this
syntax : `[]` ? or an object with this one : `{}` ?

Well, we will use another syntax for declaring our function. We will do so using
the `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax : `() => {}`

- So we first put parens `()`, These, are the containers of the `arguments` that
  go in the function. For now we will leave them empty with no arguments. (More
  on those later on)
- We then add the arrow `=>` which is the distinguishing feature of the
  `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax.
- Finally, we add the curly brackets `{}` to delimite the scope of our newly
  created function. Note: They are not always necessary, you will probably find
  examples of this function syntax without the `{}`. However, for now because
  you are learning. We will put them most of the time.

```js
//    ↙ normal variable     ↙ beginning of the scope of the function
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  //                    ↖ parens () for arguments and the arrow => for syntax
} // <-end of the scope of the function
```

It's now possible to call this function using the `()`, like any pre-declared
function:

```js
myFirstFunction() // nothing happens
```

This function if called, does not do anything, since it doesn't contain any
code.

### The scope of a function `{}`

Very much like an `if` statement a function has a scope. The scope in between
the curly braces`{}` is where the action happens. Let's add something to the
scope of our function.

```js
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  console.log('Calling my first function')
  // ↖ some instructions to do when the function is called !
}
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log()`.

```js
myFirstFunction() // "Calling my first function"
```

We actually used a function and gave it this single instruction:

- call another function `console.log()`.

### Instructions

You are a robot made by a scientist called Rick and you want to know your
purpose.

- Declare a function named `ask` that log `'What is my purpose ?'` in the
  console
- Declare a function named `reply` that log `'You pass butter.'` in the console

Then first call the `ask` then the `reply` once, in that order.

### Tests

#### `ask` is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof ask, 'function')
```

#### `reply` is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof reply, 'function')
```

#### `ask` works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[0], ['What is my purpose ?'])
```

#### `reply` works and is called too

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args, [['What is my purpose ?'], ['You pass butter.']])
```

#### calling `reply` and `ask` again relog the text.

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

equal(args[1], ['You pass butter.'])
```

## A winning argument

### Arguments

We mentioned it before with methods, functions can take arguments. They are
always in between parens `()`.

Let's use the same examples that we used for function calls:

Remember this example of function call ?

```js
//       ↙ method
console.log('Hello There !') //<-
//                 ↖ The String 'Hello There!' is
//                   the argument of console.log()
```

or these ones ?

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // The number 1.8 is the arg
console.log(roundedValue) // the variable roundedValue is the arg
```

We are now going to adapt `myFirstFuntion` so that it takes one argument :
`arg1`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = arg1 => {
  //<-arg1 is inputed in between the parens
  console.log(arg1) // arg1 can be use inside the scope of the function
  //            ↖   arg1 is "transfered" to be the arg of console.log()
} //<-end of the scope of the function
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log(arg1)`.

```js
myFirstFunction('using my first arg') // "using my first arg"
```

But let's say we want to change what the function logs. Now, instead of
modifying `myFirstFunction` we just need to modify the argument in the function
call.

```js
myFirstFunction('another arg') // "another arg"
myFirstFunction('and another one') // "and another one"
myFirstFunction('and one more') // "and one more"
```

### Instructions

You are a general's aide who has to transmit the communications to the other
soldiers.

In order to do so you will create the function `battleCry`. This function will
take one argument and will display it in the console.

The battlefield is big so make sure that the argument is uppercased before
displaying it.

Now, sometimes the communications will have to given quietly.

For this you will create the function `secretOrders` which does the same as
`battleCry` except that it lowercases the argument before sending it.

### Tests

#### battleCry is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof battleCry, 'function')
```

#### secretOrders is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof secretOrders, 'function')
```

#### battleCry has one and only one argument

```js
equal(battleCry.length, 1)
```

#### secretOrders has one and only one argument

```js
equal(secretOrders.length, 1)
```

#### battleCry shouts properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
// Your code

battleCry('attack')
battleCry('you shall not pass!')

equal(args.flat(), ['ATTACK', 'YOU SHALL NOT PASS!'])
```

#### secretOrders whispers properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

secretOrders('ExEcutE Order 66')
secretOrders('SILENCE')

equal(args.flat(), ['execute order 66', 'silence'])
```

#### We can call both functions

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

secretOrders('This Is The WAY')
battleCry('for the horde !')

equal(args.flat(), ['this is the way', 'FOR THE HORDE !'])
```

## Two can play that game

### More Arguments

We have seen how to add one argument to the a function, We are now going to see
how to add two (or more).

All we need to do to add a second argument `arg2` is to add a comma `,` after
`arg1` and then add `arg2`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2) => {
  //<-arg1 and arg2 are inputed in between the parens
  console.log(arg1, arg2)
  //            ↖   arg1 and arg2 are "transfered" to be the args of console.log()
}
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('first arg', 'second arg')
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
```

For more args, you will need to simply repeat the same process. Example with
`arg3` and `arg4`:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4) => {
  //<as many arguments as needed
  console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
} //<-end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('first arg', 'second arg', 3, 4)
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
// 3
// 4
```

Finally, please note that you can name your arguments however you please. Just
make sure that you reuse the proper name inside the scope of your function.
Example:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {
  //<as many arguments as needed
  console.log(continent, country, city, temperature)
} //<-end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')
// "Europe"
// "France"
// "Paris"
// "30°C"
```

### Instructions

You want to conquer the world! _(of entertainment)_.

In this exercise you will have to declare the function `duos`.

This function will take two arguments and will log them together with an `and`
and an `!`

> Example: calling: `duos('Batman', 'Robin')` should log : `Batman and Robin !`

You will then declare the function `duosWork`. This function will take three
arguments and will log them togethers as in the example below.

> Example: calling: `duosWork('Batman', 'Robin', 'protect Gotham')` should log :
> `Batman and Robin protect Gotham !`

### Tests

#### duos is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof duos, 'function')
```

#### duos takes two arguments

```js
equal(duos.length, 2)
```

#### duos logs the expected result

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

duos('Batman', 'Robin')
duos('Pinky', 'The Brain')
duos('Bonnie', 'Clyde')
duos('Mr.', 'Mrs.Smith')

equal(
  args.map(arg => arg.join(' ')),
  [
    'Batman and Robin !',
    'Pinky and The Brain !',
    'Bonnie and Clyde !',
    'Mr. and Mrs.Smith !',
  ],
)
```

#### duosWork is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof duosWork, 'function')
```

#### duosWork takes three arguments

```js
equal(duosWork.length, 3)
```

#### duosWork logs the expected result

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')

// Your code

duosWork('Batman', 'Robin', 'protect Gotham')
duosWork('Pinky', 'The Brain', 'want to conquer the world')
duosWork('Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'escape the Police')
duosWork('Mr.', 'Mrs.Smith', 'are the greatest spy couple')

equal(
  args.map(arg => arg.join(' ')),
  [
    'Batman and Robin protect Gotham !',
    'Pinky and The Brain want to conquer the world !',
    'Bonnie and Clyde escape the Police !',
    'Mr. and Mrs.Smith are the greatest spy couple !',
  ],
)
```

## You pass butter

### Return values

We are now going to see how to declare a function that returns a value.

Let's say we declare the variable `ten` the following way.

```js
let ten = 5 + 5
console.log(ten) // 10
```

We could replace those `5` with a function that `returns` this value. Let's call
this function `returnsFive`. The only new concept is the `return` keyword. It
returns the specified value **and** stop the function execution.

```js
let returnsFive = () => {
  return 5
  //     ↖ the keyword `return`, returns the value right after it,
  //       in this case the number 5.
}
```

Now that the function is declared, we call it where we need it.

```js
let ten = returnsFive() + returnsFive()
console.log(ten) // 10
```

Now a question that you might ask yourself is: What if we had several `return`
keywords in the same function ? Well as mentioned before, the `return` also
stops the function execution. So only the first `return` would matter. In fact
that means that anything after the `return` would not be executed. Example:

```js
let returnsFive = () => {
  return 5 // ONLY this return is executed. Everything else is ignored.
  return 10 // not executed (useless)
  return 'I am useless' // not executed either
  console.log('I am also useless') // nor this one
}
let ten = returnsFive() + returnsFive()
console.log(ten) // 10
//exactly the same result as the previous example
```

As you may see, we get exactly the same result as the previous example.
`returnsFive` only returns `5`. :)

### Instructions

As Rick's robot, you now know your purpose. (Remember ? `'You pass butter.'`)

Define the function `passButter` that returns the string `'The butter'`.

### Tests

#### passButter is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof passButter, 'function')
```

#### passButter returns The butter properly

```js
equal(passButter(), 'The butter')
```

#### calling passButter mulitple time should always return the butter

```js
equal(
  [passButter(), passButter(), passButter()],
  ['The butter', 'The butter', 'The butter'],
)
```

## A new purpose

### Treating data in and out

You know now how to declare the `arguments` and the `return` values of a
function. You know have the tools to:

- receive data in the function (in the form of the arguments)
- treat the data (in the fonction scope)
- return the treated data (with the return keyword)

You can now for example, transform this function which we used right before:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {
  console.log(continent, country, city, temperature)
} //<- end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')
// 'Europe'
// 'France'
// 'Paris'
// '30°C'
```

into:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {
  //<as many arguments as needed

  return `${city} is a city in ${country} in the continent ${continent} where the temperature is of ${temperature} today.`
} //<-end of the scope of the function
//                                         arg       arg      arg      arg
// Now we call the function ↘              in,       in,      in,      in,
let resultOfMyfunction = myFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')
//           ↖ and out
console.log(resultOfMyFunction) // below, is the log of what the function returned to us.
//  'Paris is a city in France in the continent Europe where the temperature is of 30°C today.'
```

### Instructions

As Rick's robot, you want to do something more than just pass the butter. You
want to level up so you decide to take your destiny into your own pliers. You
are going to start slow by competing with calculators.

Define the functions :

- `add2` which adds two arguments and returns the result.
- `sub2` which substract two arguments and returns the result.

### Tests

#### add2 is defined and are functions

```js
equal(typeof add2, 'function')
```

#### add2 takes 2 arguments

```js
equal(add2.length, 2)
```

#### add2 returns the right results

```js
equal(add2(1, 1), 2)
equal(add2(1, 2), 3)
equal(add2(2, 2), 4)
equal(add2(2, 3), 5)
```

#### sub2 is defined and are functions

```js
equal(typeof sub2, 'function')
```

#### sub2 takes 2 arguments

```js
equal(sub2.length, 2)
```

#### sub2 returns the right results

```js
equal(sub2(1, 1), 0)
equal(sub2(2, 1), 1)
equal(sub2(3, 1), 2)
equal(sub2(-4, -7), 3)
```

## level up

You know now, in your function declarations, how to use arguments and returns.

Let's try to now use the `if` statements in a new function called `happy`. Here
is an example:

```js
let happy = mood => {
  if (mood === 'happy') {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

let result1 = happy('happy')
let result2 = happy('sad')

console.log(result1) // true
console.log(result2) // false
```

Here we used the `if` statement, and two `return` keywords to alternate between
the result `true` or `false` depending whether the argument `mood` is equal to
the string `happy` or not. The possibilities are becoming limitless...

### Instructions

As Rick's robot, you are continuing your training to add yourself new ... skills
(I could have said funtions). You want now to become a robot bartender.

Define the function `shaker` which will take as arguments:

- `quantity`, which will be variable of type `Number`
- `fruit`, which will be a `String`
- `alcohol`, which will be a `Boolean`

`shaker` must return a `String`. Look at the examples below to understand how
`shaker` must mix its ingredients:

```js
console.log(shaker(1, 'strawberry', true))
//'1 strawberry cocktail'
console.log(shaker(2, 'chocolate', false))
//'2 chocolate milkshakes'
console.log(shaker(2, 'strawberry', true))
//'2 strawberry cocktails'
console.log(shaker(1, 'chocolate', false))
//'1 chocolate milkshake'
```

Ps: watch out for your plurals!

### Tests

#### shaker is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof shaker, 'function')
```

#### shaker has 3 arguments

```js
equal(shaker.length, 3)
```

#### shaker can make a cocktail.

```js
equal(shaker(1, 'strawberry', true), '1 strawberry cocktail')
```

#### shaker can make a milkshake.

```js
equal(shaker(1, 'strawberry', false), '1 strawberry milkshake')
```

#### shaker can make multiple cocktails.

```js
equal(shaker(7, 'banana', true), '7 banana cocktails')
```

#### shaker can make multiple milkshakes.

```js
equal(shaker(22, 'banana', false), '22 banana milkshakes')
```

#### shaker is shakin it right.

```js
equal(shaker(1, 'vanilla', true), '1 vanilla cocktail')
equal(shaker(1, 'mango', true), '1 mango cocktail')
equal(shaker(2, 'banana', true), '2 banana cocktails')
equal(shaker(2, 'chocolate', false), '2 chocolate milkshakes')
equal(shaker(2, 'vanilla', false), '2 vanilla milkshakes')
equal(shaker(2, 'strawberry', false), '2 strawberry milkshakes')
```

## 🌟 Give it a ...rest

### Instructions

You are now a butter passer, calculator, and barttender all-in-one robot. You
want to keep on improving but you can feel like your memory capacities are
reaching their limits. You will now try to improve what you aready have.

Declare the function `countArgs` which will return the number of argument it
recieved. Examples:

```js
console.log(countArgs(1)) // 1
console.log(countArgs(1, 10)) // 2
console.log(countArgs(1, 10, 100)) // 3
// etc...
```

### Tests

#### countArgs is defined and are functions

```js
equal(typeof countArgs, 'function')
```

#### countArgs returns the right results for 2 arguments

```js
equal(countArgs(1, 1), 2)
```

#### countArgs returns the right results for 3 arguments

```js
equal(countArgs(1, 2, 3), 3)
```

#### countArgs returns the right results for 4 arguments

```js
equal(countArgs(2, 2, 4, 10), 4)
```

#### countArgs returns the right results for 6 arguments

```js
equal(countArgs(2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 10), 6)
```

#### countArgs can count a lot of arguments

```js
equal(countArgs(...Array(999).fill()), 999)
```

## 🌟 Happy ?

### Notions

- [Includes](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/string/includes)
- [Conditional (ternary) Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)

### Instructions

With all that you know now you are not a truly happy, efficient and independent
robot.

You have decided that if someone ask you the question `Are you happy ?` or
questions that includes the word `happy` you will always says that it is `true`.
To do so you will declare the function `happy` which takes only one argument and
returns a boolean.

Examples:

```js
console.log(happy('Are you happy ?')) // true
console.log(happy('Happy ?')) // true
console.log(happy('Are you happy!')) // false  -> this is not a question
console.log(happy('Are you sad ?')) // false  -> wrong question
```

Any other requests will be denied with a `false`. (if it is not a question of if
it does not have the word `happy`).

And because you aim for efficiency you will contruct your fonction without the
curlys brackets `{}` and without the keyword `return` or `if`.

### Tests

#### happy is defined and is a function

```js
equal(typeof happy, 'function')
```

#### happy has 1 argument

```js
equal(happy.length, 1)
```

#### very happy.

```js
equal(happy('Are you happy ?'), true)
```

#### very happy.

```js
equal(happy('Happy ?'), true)
```

#### very happy.

```js
equal(happy('Happy ! are we not ?'), true)
```

#### not happy.

```js
equal(happy('Are you sad ?'), false)
```

#### not happy.

```js
equal(happy('happy !'), false)
```

#### not happy.

```js
equal(happy('Was I happy ? nope.'), false)
```

#### happy has no curly braces {}.

```js
if (/\{.*\}/.test(happy)) {
  throw Error('No curly braces {} ! ')
}
```

#### happy has no keyword return.

```js
if (String(happy).includes('return')) {
  throw Error('No keyword return allowed ! ')
}
```

#### happy has no keyword if.

```js
if (String(happy).includes('if')) {
  throw Error('No keyword if allowed ! ')
}
```

## 🌟 FunFunFunction

### Instruction

Declare an `exec` function that takes a function and call it

### Usage

const showMessage = () => {
  console.log('Functions inside a function ?!')
}

exec(showMessage) // log 'Functions inside a function ?!'
```

### Tests

#### `exec` execute the given function

```js
let count = 0
exec(() => {})
exec(() => count++)
exec(() => {})
exec(() => count++)
equal(count, 2)
```

## 🌟 Give Back

### Instruction

Declare an `giveBack` function an argument and return a new function that when
called will return the argument of the `giveBack` function

### Usage

```js
const give5 = giveBack(5)
const giveHello = giveBack('Hello')

```

#### calling `giveBack` return a function

```js
equal(typeof giveBack(), 'function')
```

#### `giveBack` works with numbers

```js

```

#### `giveBack` works with strings

```js
equal(giveBack('hello')(), 'hello')
```

#### `giveBack` works with `undefined`

```js
