### Remember Methods?

You have seen how to call functions that were stored in object properties.

Remember this example of function call?:

```js
//       ↙ identifier, like variables
console.log('Hello There !') // <- function call happening here
//          ↖ open paren + argument + close paren
```

or these ones?:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // another function call happening here
console.log(roundedValue) // and another one here
```

There, we saw how to call and use _"pre-declared"_ functions.

Here, now, we are going to learn how to declare our owns. This will gives us
even more freedom to build our own logic.

### Declaring a very basic function

We mentioned before that a function had to be either assigned to a variable or
an object property.

We will now declare one in a variable. Let's call it: `myFirstFunction`.

Once a variable is declared;
Remember how an array can be recognized with this syntax : `[]`?
or an object with this one : `{}` ?

Well, we will use another syntax for declaring our function.
We will do so using the `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax : `() => {}`

- So we first put parens `()`,
These, are the containers of the `arguments` that go in the function.
For now we will leave them empty with no arguments. (More on those
later on)
- We then add the arrow `=>` which is the distinguishing feature of
the `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax.
- Finally, we add the curly brackets `{}` to delimite the scope
of our newly created function.
Note: They are not always necessary, you will probably find examples
of this function syntax without the `{}`.
However, for now because you are learning. We will put them most
of the time.

```js
//    ↙ normal variable     ↙ beginning of the scope of the function
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  //                    ↖ parens () for arguments and the arrow => for syntax
} // <-end of the scope of the function
```

It's now possible to call this function using the `()`, like any pre-declared
function:

```js
myFirstFunction() // nothing happens
```

This function if called, does not do anything, since it doesn't contain any
code.

### The scope of a function `{}`

Very much like an `if` statement a function has a scope. The scope in between
the curly braces`{}` is where the action happens. Let's add something to the
scope of our function.

```js
let myFirstFunction = () => {
  console.log('Calling my first function')
  // ↖ some instructions to do when the function is called !
}
```

Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log()`.

```js
myFirstFunction() // "Calling my first function"
```

We actually used a function and gave it this single instruction:

- call another function `console.log()`.

### Instructions

You are a robot made by a scientist called Rick and you want to know your purpose.
We have declared the object `dialogue`. Declare **and call** a function named `whatIsMyPurpose`.

- This function will display in the console the value of the key `myQuestion`
in the object `dialogue`.

Declare **and call** a function named `theAnswer`.

- This function will display in the console the value of the key `Rick's answer`
in the object `dialogue`.

Hint : Make sure your console is open if you want to see the actual answer :)

### Tests

#### whatIsMyPurpose is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function whatIsMyPurpose... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof whatIsMyPurpose != 'function') {
  throw Error('whatIsMyPurpose must be a function')
}
```
#### theAnswer is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof theAnswer === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function theAnswer... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof theAnswer != 'function') {
  throw Error('theAnswer must be a function')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPurpose has no arguments

```js
if (whatIsMyPurpose.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### theAnswer has no arguments

```js
if (theAnswer.length > 0) {
  throw Error('No arguments allowed for this function! You do not need them!')
}
```

#### whatIsMyPupose works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let dialogue = {
  question: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.'
}

// Your code

whatIsMyPurpose()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('What is my purpose?')) {
  throw Error('you must log the value of the key: question')
}
const functionCalls = args.flat().filter((el)=>(el === 'What is my purpose?')).length
if (functionCalls != 2) {
  throw Error(`you must call the function whatIsMyPurpose once"`)
}
```

#### theAnswer works and is called

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let dialogue = {
  question: 'What is my purpose?',
  "Rick's answer": 'You pass butter.'
}

// Your code

theAnswer()

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('You pass butter.')) {
  throw Error(`you must log the value of the key: "Rick's answer"`)
}
const functionCalls = args.flat().filter((el)=>(el === 'You pass butter.')).length
if (functionCalls != 2) {
  throw Error(`you must call the function theAnswer once"`)
}
```

# A winning argument

### Arguments

We mentioned it before with methods, functions can take arguments.
They are always in between parens `()`.

Let's use the same examples that we used for function calls:

Remember this example of function call?:
```js
//       ↙ method
console.log('Hello There !') //<-
//                 ↖ The String 'Hello There!' is
//                   the argument of console.log()
```
or these ones?:

```js
let roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // The number 1.8 is the arg
console.log(roundedValue) // the variable roundedValue is the arg
```

We are now going to adapt `myFirstFuntion` so that it takes one
argument : `arg1`.


```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1) =>{ //<-arg1 is inputed in between the parens
    console.log(arg1) // arg1 can be use inside the scope of the function
    //            ↖   arg1 is "transfered" to be the arg of console.log()
} //<-end of the scope of the function
```
Now the function if called, display the output the `console.log(arg1)`.
```js
myFirstFunction("using my first arg") // "using my first arg"
```
But let's say we want to change what the function logs. Now, instead of
modifying `myFirstFunction` we just need to modify the argument in
the function call.


```js
myFirstFunction("another arg") // "another arg"
myFirstFunction("and another one") // "and another one"
myFirstFunction("and one more") // "and one more"
```

### Instructions

You are a general's aide who has to transmit the communications
to the other soldiers.

In order to do so you will create the function `battleCry`.
This function will take one argument and will display it
in the console.

The battlefield is big so make sure that the argument is
uppercased before displaying it.

Now, sometimes the communications will have to given quietly.

For this you will create the function `secretOrders` which
does the same as `battleCry` except that it lowercases the
argument before sending it.

### Tests

#### battleCry is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof battleCry === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function battleCry... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof battleCry != 'function') {
  throw Error('battleCry must be a function')
}
```
#### secretOrders is a defined and is a function

```js
if (typeof secretOrders === 'undefined') {
  throw Error(
    `You didn't even define the function secretOrders... make it better! reread the lesson...`,
  )
}

if (typeof secretOrders != 'function') {
  throw Error('secretOrders must be a function')
}
```

#### battleCry has one and only one argument

```js
if (battleCry.length != 1) {
  throw Error('You must use 1 argument for this function, and only one!')
}
```

#### secretOrders has one and only one argument

```js
if (secretOrders.length != 1) {
  throw Error('You must use 1 argument for this function, and only one!')
}
```

#### battleCry shouts properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let orders = {
  shouted: ['attack!', 'you shall not pass!','for the horde!'],
  secrets: ['ExEcutE Order 66', 'SILENCE', 'This Is The WAY' ]
}

// Your code

orders.shouted.map(el=> battleCry(el))

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('ATTACK!')) {
  throw Error(`battleCry('attack!') is not SHOUTING: ATTACK!`)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('YOU SHALL NOT PASS!')) {
  throw Error(`battleCry(you shall not pass!) is not SHOUTING: YOU SHALL NOT PASS!`)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('FOR THE HORDE!')) {
  throw Error(`battleCry('for the horde!') is not SHOUTING: FOR THE HORDE!`)
}
```

#### secretOrders whispers properly

```js
const args = saveArguments(console, 'log')
let orders = {
  shouted: ['attack!', 'you shall not pass!','for the horde!'],
  secrets: ['ExEcutE Order 66', 'SILENCE', 'This Is The WAY' ]
}

// Your code

orders.secrets.map(el=> secretOrders(el))

const loggedValues = args.flat().join(' ')
if (!loggedValues.includes('execute order 66')) {
  throw Error(`secretOrders('ExEcutE Order 66') is not whispering: execute order 66 `)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('silence')) {
  throw Error(`secretOrders('SILENCE') is not whispering: silence `)
}
if (!loggedValues.includes('this is the way')) {
  throw Error(`secretOrders('This Is The WAY') is not whispering: this is the way `)
}
```

## Two can play that game

### Arguments (Continued)

We have seen how to add one argument to the a function,
We are now going to see how to add two (or more).

Remember when `arg1` was added in the parens `()`?

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1) =>{
    console.log(arg1)
}
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction("using my first arg") // "using my first arg"
```
Well now, all we need to do to add a second argument `arg2` is to
add a comma `,` after `arg1` and then add `arg2`.

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2) =>{ //<-arg1 and arg2 are inputed in between the parens
    console.log(arg1, arg2)
    //            ↖   arg1 and arg2 are "transfered" to be the args of console.log()
}
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction("first arg", "second arg")
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
```
For more args, you will need to simply repeat the same process.
Example with `arg3` and `arg4`:

```js
let myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4) =>{ //<as many arguments as needed
    console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
} //<-end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction("first arg", "second arg", 3, 4)
// "first arg"
// "second arg"
// 3
// 4
```
Finally, please note that you can name your arguments however you please.
Just make sure that you reuse the proper name inside the scope of your function.
Example:
```js
let myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) =>{ //<as many arguments as needed
    console.log(continent, country, city, temperature)
} //<-end of the scope of the function
// Now we call the function
myFirstFunction("Europe", "France", "Paris", "30°C")
// "Europe"
// "France"
// "Paris"
// "30°C"
```
