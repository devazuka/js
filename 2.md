# Structures

## Object

In this exercise we will learn about structuring multiple values together

### Data Structures: Objects

In JS, `Object` are the most basic data structure, they are a way to group value
together.

They are like a bag of values.

#### Example

let's take an example of the variables we shown you for a transaction:

```js
let currency = 'EURO'
let amount = 77.5
let cashPayment = false
```

now we can group them all in a an object, as objects are values too, let's
assign one to a `transaction` variable:

```js
let transaction = {
  currency: 'EURO',
  amount: 77.5,
  cashPayment: false,
}
```

The variable `transaction` is declared and it's value is an object.

try to log it in your console:

```js
console.log({
  currency: 'EURO',
  amount: 77.5,
  cashPayment: false,
})
```

#### Object litteral syntax: `{}`

The first thing we see are curly brackets `{}`, they are the delimiters of our
object

```js
let empty = {} // an empty object
```

#### Properties

So, properties are where we define what values we want inside our objects. They
are composed of two elements

- a `key`
- and a `value`

```js
//                 ↙ begining of the declaration
let transaction = {
  //  ↙ property key
  currency: 'EURO',
  //           ↖ property value
}
// ↖ end of the declaration
```

We separate them with a `:`, for simplicity, we will only use valid identifiers
as keys at the moment.

Each properties must be separated with a `,`

> Note that it's easier to always add a trailing `,` on every properties, but
> not required.

### Instructions

Declare a variable `human` with as a value an object with 3 properties:

- a `name` property of your name as a `String`
- an `age` property of your age as a `Number`
- a `secureLuggage` of a `Boolean` saying if your luggage contain dangerous
  things or not. _(still, for obvious security reasons)_

### Tests

#### variable `human` is declared and of type object

```js
equal(typeof human, 'object')
```

#### property `name` from `human` is of type string

```js
equal(typeof human.name, 'string')
```

#### property `age` from `human` is of type number

```js
equal(typeof human.age, 'number')
```

#### property `secureLuggage` from `human` is of type boolean

```js
equal(typeof human.secureLuggage, 'boolean')
```

> ― Pablo Picasso

Well, that much is obvious, you can't see memory Pablo...

## Access

Now that we know how to define objects, let's start to use them

### The dot opperator `.` (property accessor)

Let's start with getting values from them, well, turns out you already have been
doing it a lot, remember `console.log` ?

### Instructions

We will provide a `human` variable of an object just like the one you did in the
previous exercise

Your job will be to decompose each property in it's own variable:

- define a `name` variable with the value of the `name` property of the `human`
  variable
- same for `age`
- and same for `secureLuggage`

### Tests

#### all 3 variable should be defined and have the right values

```js
let human = {
  name: 'Freddy',
  age: 27,
  secureLuggage: false,
}

// Your code

equal({ name, age, secureLuggage }, human)
```

#### value should also work for Jean-Pierre

```js
let human = {
  name: 'Jean-Pierre',
  age: 65,
  secureLuggage: true,
}

// Your code

equal({ name, age, secureLuggage }, human)
```

## Alter Ego

You can change your objects in multiple ways:

- modify values of properties
- add new properties
- delete properties

### Modifying objects

Let's declare an object

```js
// we create our object with 2 properties
const user = {
  points: 0,
  code: '75lai78wn',
}
```

#### Adding a new properperty

```js
user.name = 'Martin' // we add a name to our user
```

The syntax is very similar to modifying a variable, the only difference is we
start **from** our user and use the `.` _(property accessor operator)_

#### Changing a property value

```js
user.points = 10 // set points to 10 points
```

The syntax is the same, if the property already exist, it's value will be
changed !

#### Removing a property

```js
user.code = undefined // remove the value from a property
```

The trick here is to set it's value to `undefined` as this will clear the value
of our property

### Instructions

Modify the provided `alterEgo` variable:

- add a `self` property with the string value `'altered'`.
- add a `fullName` property that is the joined value of the `firstName` and the
  `lastName` with a space in between.
- add `10` to it's `point` property

### Tests

#### Altered object must match the expected result `Edmon Dantes`

```js
let alterEgo = {
  firstName: 'Edmond',
  lastName: 'Dantes',
  points: 247,
}

// Your code

equal(alterEgo, {
  firstName: 'Edmond',
  lastName: 'Dantes',
  points: 257,
  self: 'altered',
  fullName: 'Edmond Dantes',
})
```

#### Altered object must match the expected result `Viktor Vaughn`

```js
let alterEgo = {
  firstName: 'Viktor',
  lastName: 'Vaughn',
  points: 123,
}

// Your code

equal(alterEgo, {
  firstName: 'Viktor',
  lastName: 'Vaughn',
  points: 133,
  self: 'altered',
  fullName: 'Viktor Vaughn',
})
```

## Nested Objects

Since objects are values, nothing stops you from having objects inside objects.

This is very common and allow to model more complex things.

### Instructions

Create an object `address` with 3 properties:

- `city` property with a value of type `String`
- `postcode` property with a value of type `Number`
- `street` property with a value of type `Object` and 2 properties:
  - `name` property with a value of type `String`
  - `number` property with a value of type `Number`

### Tests

#### `address` and it's `street` property are objects

```js
equal(typeof address, 'object')
equal(typeof address.street, 'object')
```

#### all `address` properties have the correct types

```js
equal(typeof address.city, 'string')
equal(typeof address.postcode, 'number')
equal(typeof address.street.name, 'string')
equal(typeof address.street.number, 'number')
```

## The Four Seasons

Sometimes we don't need a key, we just want a list of things, JS has a special
type for that

### Arrays

Let's see an example of an `Array`:

```js
let numberList = [
  10, // <- no keys !
  20,
  30,
  40,
]

// or for brievety, we often write them on a single line like so:
let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

`Arrays` are like objects but use `[]` square bracket delimiters and only
specify values.

The `key` of an element of an array is it's position, starting from `0`. We call
that it's `index`

So our `numberList` is roughly equivalent of writing this object:

```js
let numberList = {
  0: 10,
  1: 20,
  2: 30,
  3: 40,
}
```

### Instructions

You must declare a variable `seasons` that contains 4 strings, one for each
seasons.

Starting with Spring, like the work of the Maestro Vivaldi.

> BGM:
> [Antonio Vivaldi - Le Quattro Stagioni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4YNYf39mcg)

### Tests

#### `seasons` variable must be an `Array`

```js
if (!Array.isArray(seasons)) {
  throw Error('Season must be an Array')
}
```

#### `seasons` first element must be spring

```js
equal(seasons[0].toLowerCase(), 'spring')
```

#### `seasons` second element summer

```js
equal(seasons[1].toLowerCase(), 'summer')
```

#### `seasons` third element autumn

```js
equal(seasons[2].toLowerCase(), 'autumn')
```

#### `seasons` fourth element winter

```js
equal(seasons[3].toLowerCase(), 'winter')
```

#### `seasons` we must not have a fifth element

```js
equal(seasons[4], undefined)
```

## Last First Kiss

### Accessing an array value `[index]`

Since numbers are not valid identifers we can not use the `.` operator to access
value in an array, but we can use the `[index]` square brackets to access a
value.

Example:

```js
let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40]
console.log(numberList[0]) // -> 10
console.log(numberList[3]) // -> 40
console.log(numberList[6]) // -> undefined
```

Since we start at `0`, `[0]` will get the value at the first index.

> note that if we try to access an element that doesn't exist we will get
> `undefined` as a value, just like non existing properties for object.

#### Using the `.length` property

Another difference of the lists is that they always keep track of how many
elements are inside them.

You can use the `.length` property to get this value:

```js
console.log([].length) // -> 0
console.log([1].length) // -> 1
console.log([1, 1, 1, 1].length) // -> 4
```

### Instructions

We provide you a variable `list` that contains some elements, you will have to
access them and assign their values in variables:

- a variable `first` of the first element of the `list`
- a variable `last` of the last element of the `list`
- a variable `kiss` of an array of 2 elements the last and the first element of
  the `list`, in that order.

### Tests

>     🧑‍🎤 ............ Oh, ........... 🧑‍🎤 \
>     🎶 .. I wanna be last, yeah ... 🎶 \
>     🎵 . Baby let me be your last . 🎵 \
>     ✨ ... Your last first kiss ... ✨ \
>     ― One Direction

#### `first` is the value of the first element

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(first, 'Harry Styles')
```

#### `first` is the value of the first element even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(first, '2011 - Up All Night')
```

#### `last` is the value of the last element

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(last, 'Louis Tomlinson')
```

#### `last` is the value of the last element even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(last, '2015 - Made in the A.M.')
```

#### `kiss` is an array of `last` and `first`

```js
let list = [
  'Harry Styles',
  'Niall Horan',
  'Liam Payne',
  'Louis Tomlinson',
  // 'Zayn Malik', ??
]

// Your code

equal(kiss, ['Louis Tomlinson', 'Harry Styles'])
```

#### `kiss` is an array of `last` and `first` even if we change the `list`

```js
let list = [
  '2011 - Up All Night',
  '2012 - Take Me Home',
  '2013 - Midnight Memories',
  '2014 - Four',
  '2015 - Made in the A.M.',
]

// Your code

equal(kiss, ['2015 - Made in the A.M.', '2011 - Up All Night'])
```

## Swap

Like `Objects` we can modify our arrays

### replacing an `Array` value

Let's look at an example of code:

```js
let weekDays = [
  'Monday',
  'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday',
  'Thursday',
  'Friday',
  'Saturday',
  'Sunday',
]

// Let's say I don't want Monday but a Second Sundays
weekDays[0] = 'Second Sunday'
```

In this example, we select the element at index `0` (with `weekDays[0]`) and
then assign it using the `=` (assign operator) the value `'Sunday 2'`

Now my array look like this:

```js
;[
  'Second Sunday',
  'Tuesday',
  'Wednesday',
  'Thursday',
  'Friday',
  'Saturday',
  'Sunday',
]
```

### Instructions

- You must replace the third element of the provided `replaceMe` array by the
  string `'great'`
- You must swap the first and second element of the provided `swapMe` array.

Example:

```js
['pif','paf','pom'] -> ['paf','pif','pom'] // last element is untouched
```

> You must modify the `swapMe` array, not create a new one !

### Tests

#### `replaceMe` second element is `'great'`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']

// Your code

equal(replaceMe, ['This', 'is', 'great', '!'])
```

#### 1st and 2nd elements of `swapMe` are swapped `pif,paf,pom`

```js
const replaceMe = ['This', 'is', 'horrible', '!']
const swapMe = ['pif', 'paf', 'pom']

// Your code

equal(swapMe, ['paf', 'pif', 'pom'])
```

## Mixed

Unlike feelings, mixed data can be great !

### Mixed data types

Like, objects, arrays are values and so you can have arrays of arrays or arrays
of objects or arrays of objects with arrays in them or... well, you get the
picture.

### Functions

Functions in JS allows you to describe multiple `instructions`, in other words,
it's a way to execute code inside your code !

That seems pretty complicated but it is the build block of your programs.

You already have been using a `function` as `console.log` is one ! You can easly
spot them because we stick paren after their identifers `()`.

For example, here's a **function call**:

```js
//       ↙ identifier, like variables
console.log('Hello There !')
//          ↖ open paren + argument + close paren
```

#### function name (`identifier`)

First things that appears in a function is the `identifier`, in fact, in JS,
functions are `variables` with a value of type `function`

So like a variable, you use it by writting it's `identifier`

> Now, `console.log` is not a valid `identifier` you may say as `.` is a special
> character, and you are perfectly right, this is a special case that we will
> explain once we talk about `Objects`, another very important fundamental
> element of your programs.

#### function calling

Now function actually do something, and they can return a result, a new value.

`console.log` does not return a value, but it will do something: make it's
arguments appear in the console.

To `call` the function, in other word run it, we need too add `()`.

```js
console.log // function is not used, nothing happen
console.log() // function was called ! an empty line appear in the console
console.log(4) // function was called with 4 and it appears in the console
```

#### function `arguments`

So in that last example, number `4` was the argument of the `console.log`
function

A function will execute the same code on different arguments, making them
flexible.

> Sometimes, `arguments` are named `parameters`, we just like to use 10
> different names for everything to sound smart.

JS gives you plenty of readymade functions, for now we are going to focus on
those that allow you to convert types.

#### function `return values`

Now to do anything from the result of our function we will need to keep it's
return value somehow, we can use our trusty `variables` for that !

```js
let stringResult = String(true) // Here we assign the result of our function call
```

Now my variable `stringResult` value is the string `'true'` and it is a normal
variable that we can use like anyother

```js
let stringResult = String(true)
console.log(stringResult)
```

You can also pass the result of a function directly to another function without
using an intermediary variable, so for example we could have written directly:

```js
console.log(String(true)) // double functions call !!!! woaaaa
```

## All Caps

### Methods

Methods are a special kind of functions, they are functions called **from**
another value.

So that's what the `.` in `console.log` is for, we call the function `log`
**from** the `console`, so it will run it's actions using the console.

Now every value types have methods in JS, for example, numbers have a special
`toFixed` method that allow you to specify how many decimals you want when you
convert them to string:

```js
let thirdOf10 = 10 / 3
console.log(String(thirdOf10)) // -> '3.3333333333333335' that's a lot...
console.log(thirdOf10.toFixed(3)) // -> '3.333' that's quite enough !
console.log(thirdOf10.toFixed()) // -> with no argument, we get just '3'
```

So here in that last line we call `toFixed` from the value of the variable
`thirdOf10`, with the argument `3`, saying that we want 3 decimal numbers in our
string conversion.

Just like function, they return values that you can assign to variables.

### Instructions

One of the value with the most methods are strings, you can do a lot of things
with them.

For this exercise you will have to use `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase` from the
provided variables.

Create a `noCaps` variable of the value of `message` but in lower case Create a
`allCaps` variable of the value of `message` but in upper case

### Tests

```js
let message = 'YoU cAn CaLl Me YoUr MaJeStY!'

// Your code

equal(noCaps, 'you can call me your majesty!')
equal(allCaps, 'YOU CAN CALL ME YOUR MAJESTY!')
```

```js
let message = `DoN'T tAlK aBoUt My MoMs, Yo`

// Your code

equal(noCaps, `don't talk about my moms, yo`)
equal(allCaps, `DON'T TALK ABOUT MY MOMS, YO`)
```

## Wololo

#### Converting types

As you now know, the number `42` is different than the string `'42'`, but if we
write `` `${42}` `` we converted the number to a string !

We see it because of the delimiters, but it is also true for the memory in your
computer.

For example we can not multiply strings, if you try to do `'hello' * 2` or
`'hello' * 'hello'` you will have an unexpected result.

> Well what were you expecting really ? `'hellohello'` maybe ?

So sometimes it is usefull to go from strings to number to boolean _and back !_

- `Number` is a function to convert to a number.
- `Boolean` is a function to convert to a boolean.
- `String` is a function to convert to, you guessed it, a string.

So to convert a `boolean` to a `string` we would write:

```js
String(true)
```

One other way we can use `placeholders` for, is to convert from any values to a
string, but using functions is more clear than abusing placeholder syntax:

```js
let str42Placeholder = `${42}` // was this a mistake ?
let str42Function = String(42) // ah okey we want a string !
```

> so there you have it, calling, arguments and return values, let's see you
> apply all of that now

### Instructions

For this exercise, we provide 3 variables `num`, `bool` and `str` of a matching
type.

Using the magical power of functions, execute the following conversions:

- a `stringFromNumber` variable of the converted value of `num` to a `string`
- a `stringFromBoolean` variable of the converted value of `bool` to a `string`
- a `numberFromString` variable of the converted value of `str` to a `number`
- a `numberFromBoolean` variable of the converted value of `bool` to a `number`
- a `booleanFromString` variable of the converted value of `str` to a `boolean`
- a `booleanFromNumber` variable of the converted value of `num` to a `boolean`

### Tests

#### `bool` and `num` must be converted to string

```js
let bool = true
let num = 4 / 3
let str = ''

// Your code

equal(stringFromNumber, '1.3333333333333333')
equal(stringFromBoolean, 'true')
```

#### `bool` and `str` must be converted to numbers

```js
let bool = true
let str = '43.75'
let num = 0

// Your code

equal(numberFromBoolean, 1)
equal(numberFromString, 43.75)
```

#### `num` and `str` must be converted to bools

```js
let num = 0
let str = 'Hello there :)'
let bool = false

// Your code

equal(booleanFromString, true)
equal(booleanFromNumber, false)
```

#### conversion should apply if we change the values

```js
let bool = false
let str = ''
let num = 43.75

// Your code

equal(stringFromNumber, '43.75')
equal(stringFromBoolean, 'false')
equal(numberFromBoolean, 0)
equal(numberFromString, 0)
equal(booleanFromString, false)
equal(booleanFromNumber, true)
```
